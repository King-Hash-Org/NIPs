# NIPs
The NodeDAO Improvement Proposals (NIPs) provide the foundation for the NodeDAO Protocol's governance principles. This document outlines the vision and goals of NodeDAO, as well as the principles, processes, and stakeholders involved in making decisions that shape the protocol's future. It also explains the process for proposing and ratifying improvements to these rules. Stay informed and up-to-date on the latest developments with NodeDAO by reading the NIPs.

## The NodeDAO Vision
Discover the future of liquid staking with NodeDAO - a cutting-edge solution that prioritizes composability and user interests. Unlike traditional liquid staking derivatives, NodeDAO is built on a decentralized governance model that empowers the community and protects against value extraction by third parties. With advanced technology that maximizes liquidity efficiency, NodeDAO is leading the charge in the next generation of liquid staking solutions. Join the NodeDAO community and be a part of shaping the future of liquid staking.

## NodeDAO Improvement Principles
Before you initiate a pull request, please read the [NIP-1](./NIPS/nip-1.md) process document. 
Ideas should be thoroughly discussed during NodeDAO meetings or NodeDAO discord first.

## Making changes to the NodeDAO Protocol
NodeDAO Improvement Proposals (NIPs) are the primary mechanism by which the NodeDAO community can submit, discuss, and approve changes relevant to the NodeDAO Protocol. 
These discussions and decisions should be guided by the governance and design principles above.

NIPs are classified into three categories:
- A **Standards Track NIP** describes any change that affects NodeDAO implementations, such as—a change to the smart contract, a change in fees, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using NodeDAO protocol. Standards Track NIPs consist of two parts—a design document, and an implementation. Furthermore, Standards Track NIPs can be broken down into the following categories:
  - **Core**: improvements requiring an upgrade of the contracts, including updating of contract parameters such as fees & comissions, and recovery action against an attack.
  - **Oracle**: includes improvements around oracle implementation.
  - **NRC**: application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards, operator registries and library/package formats.

- A **Meta NIP** describes a process surrounding NodeDAO or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process NIPs are like Standards Track NIPs but apply to areas other than the NodeDAO protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to NodeDAO's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational NIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in NodeDAO development. Any meta-NIP is also considered a Process NIP.

- An **Informational NIP** describes an NodeDAO design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the NodeDAO community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational NIPs do not necessarily represent NodeDAO community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational NIPs or follow their advice.

It is highly recommended that a single NIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the NIP, the more successful it tends to be.

A NIP must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

## A decentralized, fairer Ethereum
NodeDAO is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to play a central role in Ethereum moving forward. To help the protocol grow and evolve, it is critical for the community to collectively be engaged in proposing, discussing, and implementing changes that improve the protocol and its operations.

These improvement proposals helps achieve that objective for all members of the NodeDAO community (developers, operators, token holders, ecosystem partners, and more).
