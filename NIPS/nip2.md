## Abstract

NodeDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) was established by Kinghash to oversee the protocol's decentralized administration.<br /> The NodeDAO is responsible for making major protocol-related decisions.<br /> This can guarantee that the protocol is in line with the interests of all parties involved and  promotes decentralized governance. 

## Motivation

Looking for a solution that can benefit everyone and where every user/holders gets to have a say. 

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

## Roles and Responsibilities of a DAO Member

a. Proposes/participates in voting on proposals to the DAO's governance structure.<br />
b. Manage NodeDAO's treasury funds - usage of accumulated protocol fees, income.<br />
c. Setting and adjusting fee rates for NodeDAO protocol to be self-sustainable.<br />
d. Striving ways for future steps for the NodeDAO protocol and ecosystem.<br />

## How to join as a Trusted Node Operator
a. Identity should be verified. <br />
b. Have a positive reputation in the web3/blockchain community.<br />
c. Not have a history of dubious conduct (as determined by a review of staking history).<br />

## Trusted Node Operator
Trusted node operators on NodeDAO protocol must be licensed financial entities. As a node operator, youâ€™ll manage and run authoring nodes that keep the Polymesh blockchain secure and operational at all times.

## Security Considerations

All NIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. NIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An NIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.
